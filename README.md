# Basic Java Methods – NOVI Backend Java Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solution for the **Basic Methods** assignment from the Backend Java module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).

The goal of this project is to gain practical experience with writing Java methods, using **if-else**, **if-else-if**, **switch statements**, and **parameterized methods**. This assignment helps solidify understanding of **control flow** and **method calls**.
